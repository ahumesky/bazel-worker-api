# Bazel Persistent Worker API

This repository contains the code for Bazel's [Persistent Worker](https://bazel.build/remote/persistent) API.

There are two Bazel modules in this repository:

* [**proto**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-worker-api/tree/main/proto): contains the bare protocol buffers for the worker API.
* [**java**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-worker-api/tree/main/java): contains a simple Java wrapper library.
